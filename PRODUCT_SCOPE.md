# Product Scope

## What This Product IS

An **automated competitor website change tracker**. You add competitor URLs; the system crawls their sites on a schedule (or on demand), captures snapshots (HTML + screenshots), and detects what changed between runs. You get a chronological feed of changes—text edits, new/removed elements, CTA changes, nav updates—with before/after screenshots and rule-based categories (e.g. Pricing & Offers, Trust & Credibility). No manual diffing, no spreadsheets.

## What This Product is NOT

- **Not** an AI or LLM product. No natural-language analysis, summaries, or recommendations.
- **Not** an SEO or rank tracker. No keywords, backlinks, or SERP data.
- **Not** a sentiment or brand-monitoring tool. No social listening or sentiment scoring.
- **Not** a forecasting or “what will they do next” engine. We record what changed; we don’t predict.

## Target Users

- **Founders** keeping an eye on how competitors present themselves and change messaging.
- **Product / marketing managers** tracking positioning, pricing, and product page updates.
- **Marketers and agencies** monitoring multiple competitor sites for clients in one place.

All of them want **factual, deterministic change tracking**—not AI interpretation.

## Core Value

**Automated competitor website change tracking**: add competitors, set crawl frequency, get a clear feed of what changed, where, and when, with evidence (screenshots and categories).

## Non-Goals

- AI analysis, summarization, or recommendations.
- SEO tracking (keywords, rankings, backlinks).
- Sentiment or brand/social monitoring.
- Forecasting or predictive features.
- Deep custom analytics; focus is on “what changed” and “where.”
